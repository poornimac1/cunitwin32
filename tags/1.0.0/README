So why another unit testing framework? There was nothing out there that
met my requirements. Namely:

1. It has to work in Microsoft Windows (yeah, yeah I know)

2. Tests should be independent. That means global/static variables HAVE 
   to be in a known state. That means each test has to execute as a 
   seperate process.
   
3. Something free would be nice.

Maybe there is something out there, but I didn't find it :-)

So how do I use it? (you ask) Simple (I say). Look at the sample code.

1. The source being tested resides within the 'Sample' directory.
2. The test harness is within 'test-sample'
3. The framework is main.c and getopt.c/.h
4. test-sample\test_def.h contains the unit tests.
    
    The macro DEFINE_TEST( testname ) is used to add tests to the suite.
    
    Add the actual test code as...
    
        void testname(void)
        { 
         ...
         TEST_ASSERT(condition);
        }
        
    ...within the TEST_DECL_ONCE section.
    
Now one thing you'll find is, you can't put a break point inside a test
(It won't work). Well actually it will but you have to provide the
following command line argument:

    --test testname
    
Well that's it really. So go forth and test!
